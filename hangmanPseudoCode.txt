I feel overwhelmed because if I reach out to GA and it fails then they'll tell me I still can't come and she is fustrated and won't allow me back in the school. Then I can't come to see these people I'd like to see there at GA and we'll just have to reach out to them in github.

If I can't convence the guy from Gtown to have me working there then I'll be in square one. so I'm not losing just gaining 

but what hurts is then I don't want to fail my head is telling me.

I don't want my resume to be bad. that's why I'm slacking I'm tired too. So I'll sleep and hopefully I feel better when I'm back up!
-------------------------------
I wasn't ready to send that so I'll work on this project till 5p and then do the resume thing.

-------------------------
TO DO.
1. draw the look
2. research best way to code this
 - how to do pop-box
 - inspirations
3. form a logic in coding that make this possible
4. do it, code!
_______________________________________
TO DO:
GOAL1: stop dbl-letters
- type a key
 
- (check if letter has not been guessed)
- if true,
  (check if it's in word) 
  ~ if true,
   - call isUsed()
    ~ //it takes char, add & return false [unused]
    ~ //return true [used] 
   - add it to good list
  ~ if false, 
   - push it to bad list
   - draw the hang man
   - score up the scoreboard
- if false,
  ~ console.log("Entered")

GOAL2: put wrong letter in 'bad' and update picture
GOAL3: keep live count
GOAL4: have a game over or game won
